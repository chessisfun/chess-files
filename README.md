Here are some chess files that I have created and want to share. Feel free to use these files for any purpose, just don't claim ownership. Also see my Lichess studies at https://lichess.org/study/by/TeachingMaterials

**Description of individual materials**:

    1. Introduction to Chess Rules
        This is a book with explanations of the rules of chess and many supporting exercises. It
        will be most useful for complete beginners, but the exercises could be useful for
        other inexperienced players.
    
    2. Introduction to Chess Tactics
        This is a book of tactics exercises. It starts with simple mate-in-1 problems and gets
        harder from there, covering all the major tactical themes (pins, forks, skewers, etc.)
        and major checkmate patterns (Anastasia, Arabian, etc.).

    3. Introduction to Chess Strategy
        This book provides a brief overview of the most important strategic ideas. It consists
        of relatively simple examples, discussed more with words than with variations.

**About me**: I have played and taught chess for many years. I am rated ~2000 USCF. In teaching chess I have worked with both adults and children in both group and individual settings. I have worked extensively with beginners and lower rated players. You can reach me at chessisfun2003@proton.me with any questions or comments.
