# chess-files
Here are some chess files that I have created and want to share. Feel free to use these files for any purpose, just don't claim ownership. Also see my Lichess studies at https://lichess.org/study/by/TeachingMaterials

**Description of individual materials**:

    1. Introduction to Chess Rules
        Explanations of the rules of chess with many supporting exercises. Mostly for
        beginners, but the exercises could be useful for other inexperienced players.
    
    2. Introduction to Chess Tactics
        Collection of tactics exercises. Begins with simple mate-in-1 problems and gets
        harder from there, covering all the major tactical themes (pins, forks, etc.)
        and major checkmate patterns (Anastasia, Arabian, etc.).

    3. Introduction to Chess Strategy
        Brief overview of the most important strategic ideas. Relatively simple examples,
        discussed more with words than with variations.

    4. Introduction to Chess Endgames (first draft)
        Explains the most important theoretical endgames with many exercises.
