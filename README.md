# chess-files
Here are some chess files that I have created. Feel free to use them for any purpose, just don't claim ownership. The files here are mostly in pdf or pgn format. The pdfs are better for reading while the pgns can be loaded into chess programs like Scid vs. PC or a Lichess study.

Available files:

    1. How to Play Chess (How-to-Play-Chess.pdf)
        -Description: explanations of the rules of chess and many supporting exercises.
        -Recommended for: < 1200 or anyone learning the rules for the first time.
        -Study approach: read the explanations and solve the exercises.
            Go through the book many times until the exercises become easy.
    
    2. Tactics Course (Tactics-Course.pdf, tactics-course.pgn)
        -Description: instructive course of tactics exercises with solutions.
        -Recommended for: 1200-1800 or < 1200 and comfortable with the exercises in How to Play Chess.
        -Study approach: solve exercises and check solutions. Spend no more than 3 minutes solving
            a problem. Go through the book many times until the answers come quickly (< 10
            seconds per problem).
        -Notes: begins with simple mate-in-1 problems and gets progressively harder. Covers
            standard tactical motifs (pin, fork, skewer, etc.) and checkmate patterns (Anastasia,
            Arabian, etc.).
    
    3. Classic Games (classic-games.pgn)
        -Description: Great games from chess history, unannotated.
        -Recommended for: not necessarily recommended. Could be useful for someone > 1600 who
            has read some strategy books. Could be useful for a teacher looking for games to use
            in lessons.
        -Notes: No comments or variations, just the games. Collected from various sources and
            not thoroughly checked for accuracy.
