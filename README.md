# chess-files
Here are some chess files that I have created and want to share.

The **pdf** files are like traditional books and are best for reading directly. These are probably the ones you want if you aren't sure. The **pgn** files aren't meant to be read, but can be loaded in a chess program like SCID or a Lichess study.

Feel free to use these files for any purpose, just don't claim ownership.

Description of materials:

    1. How to Play Chess (How-to-Play-Chess.pdf, How-to-Play-Chess-Exercises-Only.pdf)
        This is a book with explanations of the rules of chess and many supporting exercises. It will
        be most useful for beginners, but the exercises could be useful for players rated below 1300.
        The exercises-only version doesn't include the explanatory sections and could be useful if
        you want to print worksheets for a class, for example.
    
    2. Tactics Course (Tactics-Course.pdf, tactics-course.pgn)
        This is a book of tactics exercises. It starts with simple mate-in-1 problems and gets harder
        from there, covering all the major tactical themes (pins, forks, skewers, etc.) and major
        checkmate patterns (Anastasia, Arabian, etc.).  This will be most useful for players who are
        comfortable with the exercises in How to Play Chess or who are rated at least 1300.
    
    3. Classic Games (classic-games.pgn)
        This is a pgn collection of great games from history. The games have no variations or
        comments. This isn't really an organized course of study like some of the other materials
        and would be most useful for experienced players looking for a collection of important
        historical games.
