# chess-files
Here are some chess files that I have created. Feel free to use them for any purpose, just don't claim ownership. The files here are mostly in pdf or pgn format. The pdfs are better for reading while the pgns can be loaded into chess programs like Scid vs. PC or a Lichess study.

Available files:

    1. How to Play Chess (How-to-Play-Chess.pdf, beginner-exercises.pgn)
        -Description: explanations of the rules of chess and many supporting exercises.
        -Recommended for: unrated and < 1000.
        -Study approach: read the explanations and solve the exercises.
            Go through the book many times until the exercises become easy.
        -Notes: pgn only includes the exercises, not the instructional sections.
    
    2. Tactics Course (Tactics-Course.pdf, tactics-course.pgn)
        -Description: instructive course of tactics exercises with solutions.
        -Recommended for: 1000-1800, though could be okay for others.
        -Study approach: solve exercises and check solutions. Spend no more than 3 minutes solving a problem. Go
            through the book many times until the answers come quickly (< 10 seconds per problem).
        -Notes: begins with simple mate-in-1 problems and gets progressively harder. Covers standard tactical motifs
            (pin, fork, skewer, etc.) and checkmate patterns (anastasia, arabian, etc.).
    
    3. Classic Games (classic-games.pgn)
        -Description: Great games from chess history, unannotated.
        -Recommended for: not necessarily recommended. Could be useful for someone > 1800 who has read some strategy
            books. Could be useful for a teacher looking for games to use in lessons.
        -Notes: No comments or variations, just the games. Collected from various sources and not thoroughly
            checked for accuracy.
