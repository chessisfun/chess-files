# chess-files
Here are some chess files that I have created and want to share. Feel free to use these files for any purpose, just don't claim ownership. Also see my Lichess studies at https://lichess.org/study/by/TeachingMaterials

**About the materials**: The **pdf** files are like traditional books and are best for reading directly. These are probably the ones you want if you aren't sure. The **pgn** files aren't meant to be read, but can be loaded in a chess program like SCID or Chessbase.

**Description of individual materials**:

    1. How to Play Chess (How-to-Play-Chess.pdf, How-to-Play-Chess-Exercises-Only.pdf)
        This is a book with explanations of the rules of chess and many supporting exercises. It
        will be most useful for complete beginners, but the exercises could be useful for
        players rated below 1000. The exercises-only version doesn't include the explanatory
        sections and could be useful if you want to print worksheets for a class, for example.
    
    2. Introduction to Tactics (Tactics-Course.pdf, tactics-course.pgn)
        This is a book of tactics exercises. It starts with simple mate-in-1 problems and gets
        harder from there, covering all the major tactical themes (pins, forks, skewers, etc.)
        and major checkmate patterns (Anastasia, Arabian, etc.).

    3. Introduction to Strategy (Introduction-to-Strategy-First-Draft.pdf)
        This book provides a brief overview of the most important strategic ideas. It consists
        of relatively simple examples, discussed more with words than with variations.

**About me**: I have played and taught chess for many years. I am rated USCF 20xx and Lichess Classical 22xx. In teaching chess I have worked with both adults and children in both group and individual settings. I have worked extensively with beginners and lower rated players. You can reach me at chessisfun2003@proton.me with any questions or comments.
